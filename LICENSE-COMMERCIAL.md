# CollaborNest Commercial License

## Overview

This document outlines the commercial licensing options for **CollaborNest**, an alternative to the AGPL-3.0 license for organizations that cannot or prefer not to comply with AGPL-3.0 requirements.

---

## Why a Commercial License?

The GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0) requires that:

1. **Network use = Distribution**: If you run a modified version as a network service (SaaS), you must make the source code available to all users
2. **Share modifications**: Any modifications must be released under AGPL-3.0
3. **Open source requirement**: Cannot integrate into closed-source products

A commercial license removes these restrictions.

---

## Commercial License Benefits

✅ **No source code disclosure**: Keep your modifications proprietary
✅ **SaaS without obligations**: Run CollaborNest as a hosted service without sharing code
✅ **Closed-source integration**: Embed CollaborNest in proprietary software
✅ **Priority support**: Direct access to core developers
✅ **Custom features**: Dedicated development for your use case
✅ **SLA guarantees**: Production-ready support with uptime commitments

---

## Use Cases

### 1. SaaS Providers

You want to offer CollaborNest as part of your hosted healthcare platform:

- **AGPL-3.0**: Must open-source all modifications and customizations
- **Commercial License**: Keep your enhancements proprietary

### 2. Healthcare Vendors

You want to integrate CollaborNest into your closed-source EHR system:

- **AGPL-3.0**: Would require open-sourcing your entire EHR system
- **Commercial License**: Integrate without license contamination

### 3. Enterprise Deployments

You need modifications for compliance/security but cannot share them:

- **AGPL-3.0**: Security-sensitive changes must be public
- **Commercial License**: Keep internal modifications private
